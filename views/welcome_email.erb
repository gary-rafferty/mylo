Hi there,

Thanks for signing up for MYLO.
There are some things that we need to get off our chest; so here goes.

* MYLO is currently in alpha stages, and should be considered experimental.
* It was built for the ReddAPI app contest (voting for MYLO will make you awesome (if you're already awesome, then it'll make you even more awesome)).
* There is a charge of 1% on all successful transactions. This will likely change.
* It hasn't got a lot of horsepower and might be slow, but if there's enough interest, then I'll pay for some more resources. 

We are working really hard to make it real-world ready.
We will keep you updated as we progress,

Thanks again,
